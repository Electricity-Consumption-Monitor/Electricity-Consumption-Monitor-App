#Overview
The main goal of this program is to calculate the electricity bill price by processing user inputs. 
We implemented some quality-of-life APIs to help ease the use of the program as well as provide efficient 
features to the user. APIs such as "OpenWeatherMap" to get the weather temperature of the user's city.
Another API is "IPSTACK" to get the user's location automatically without them writing anything.
We also applied 2 design patterns in our code and they are 'Singleton' and 'Decorator'.

First, we can see the temperature of the user's city

Second, we ask the user to enter the name of the building.

Lastly, we ask the user to enter all rooms in the building with how many devices in them
and then information about the devices. Then we will calculate the price bill.
