The main goal of this program is to calculate the electricity bill price by processing user inputs. 
We implemented some quality-of-life APIs to help ease the use of the program as well as provide efficient 
features to the user. APIs such as "OpenWeatherMap" to get the weather temperature of the user's city.
Another API is "IPSTACK" to get the user's location automatically without them writing anything.
